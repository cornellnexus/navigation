This is the test script run on the raspberry pi to send over a hard-coded telemetry packet to be 
updated on the other device's (PC's) GUI window.

# Testing Procedure: 

# 1. Initialize Radio modules (raspberry pi + PC). Ensure that data can be transmitted & received properly (turn them on.)

# 2. Initialize GUI running at the same time on PC

# 3. Begin transmitting data from the raspberry piâ€™s radio module (read packets from a gui_to_rpi.csv)
