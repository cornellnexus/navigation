# Testing Procedure: 

# 1. Initialize Radio modules (raspberry pi + computer). Ensure that data can be transmitted & received properly. 

# 2. Initialize GUI running at the same time  

# 3. Begin transmitting data from the raspberry piâ€™s radio module (read packets from a gui_to_rpi.csv)

rpi_to_gui = open((get_path('tests')[-1] + '/functionality_tests/csv/gui_to_rpi.csv'), "r")  # open csv file of rpi to gui data

#   packet = str(rpi_to_gui.readlines()[-1]) + "\n" # get last line of csv file

  print("Sending the following packet: " + str(packet))
  ser.write(cast_data)
#   TODO: need to figure out when we want data to be transmitted in the code

# Now try in sim trajectory - uncomment # RPI_GUI_TEST lines in sim trajectory


# 4. Check if the GUI has updated as expected. 




# Run gui_to_rpi.py on raspberry pi, sending just a basic packet
# Run retrieve_inputs on personal laptop, monitor prints as well as robot_data.csv
