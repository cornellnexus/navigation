# Testing Procedure: 

# 1. Initialize Radio modules (raspberry pi + computer). Ensure that data can be transmitted & received properly. 

# 2. Initialize GUI running at the same time  

# 3. Begin transmitting data from the raspberry piâ€™s radio module (read packets from a gui_to_rpi.csv) 

#   TODO: need to figure out when we want data to be transmitted in the code

# 4. Check if the GUI has updated as expected.
