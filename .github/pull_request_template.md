## Summary
### TLDR: 1-3 sentence TLDR here
<!-- e.g TLDR: Currently, all the waypoints on our Matplotlib popup graph for our robot simulation are all the same color. 
To differentiate between active and inactive nodes, active nodes will be colored blue and inactive nodes will be colored red.
This will allow the user to visually see where the robot plans to go. -->
